# Problem Description
The problem we were tasked with was building a relational database for Ace Academy tennis club that classifies and connects their activities, members, and services offered. The main entity of the model was the Members as they represent the most important factor of the club. The members can reserve and play on the courts, participate in tournaments, buy items from the proshop, and schedule lessons with coaches. The problem we were tasked with was how to set up a database that accurately reflected the multiple relationships a player can have, while also acknowledging other relationships existed between entities previously mentioned and non-members can use or participate in other attributes of the club as well. Our main goal in this is to accurately fill the databases and model the relationships in order to give the management team an accurate glimpse into the data and relationships that exist wtihin their club.
